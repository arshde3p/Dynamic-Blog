GET STARTED!!


In this application you can create a user by clicking on the "Register" button that is at the top right corner of the main page. A new user needs to create a "Username", provide his/her "Email address" and create a "Password" to register. After registration of your account you will be redirected to the login page where you will login using the "Username" and "Password" that you have created.

"Hurray!!"You have finally joined the blog. 

Now there is a "Profile" button on the navigation bar and clicking that will redirect you to your profile page where you can change your "Username", "Email Address" and upload a profile picture. Then you may create a post by clicking on the "New Post" button which is located on the top right corner of your "Home" page. In this new post you have to mention the "Title" and the "Content" for your post and then click the "Post" button below the "Content" box.

Further for updating your current post you will see an "Update" button below your post along with a "Delete" button to delete that post. In case if you forgot your password and you want to change it then you can either redirect yourself to http://127.0.0.1:8000/password-reset/ or on the login page you will find a "Forget Password?" button and then you will be redirected to "Reset Password" page where you will have to provide your "Email Address". A link will be sent to your provided email address to reset your current password  and clicking that will redirect you to another "Reset Password" page where you can reset your password. You can click on any "Username" in the "Home" page and check all the posts which that user has ever created. After that if you want to logout then there is a "Logout" button for doing so.
